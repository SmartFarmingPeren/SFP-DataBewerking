## Introduction

PlantScan3D is software with a GUI. As TI students we hate this kind of software. In order to make the software TI
approved we are going te remove the GUI to make the software easier to work with. Make sure to read the full read-me the
pay-off is huge.

## Requirements

In order for this software to be used a lot of pain needs to be sit trough. We spent a couple of days stripping the GUI
from PlantScan3D. A new approach made it possible for our own code to work. The following requirements are needed:

1. Pycharm(students can get professional for free)[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/]
2. Anaconda[https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads]

The openalea requirements are installed at a later time.

1. openalea[https://github.com/openalea]
2. openalea.mtg[https://github.com/openalea/mtg]
3. openalea.plantgl[https://github.com/openalea/plantgl]
4. openalea.plantscan3d[https://github.com/openalea/plantscan3d]
