# skeletonization

## Introduction
The Skeletonization folder holds the main code used to skeletonize point clouds.

The code takes a point cloud either generated by simultation or aquired by data aquisition. 
A point cloud should have between 50.000 and 100.000 points[TODO These parameters are not yet confirmed].

The input point clouds should be placed in the /Inputs/Pointclouds/ folder.
The code either takes one point cloud or the whole folder.

## Running the code
`python main.py`
