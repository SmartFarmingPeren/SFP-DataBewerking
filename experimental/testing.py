    The direction of a vector is usually defined by ignoring its length,
    or alternatively by setting its length to one.
    So we need to first define the length, which is

    L = âˆš(x*x + y*y + z*z).

    We can define the vector

    x/L, y/L, z/L

    which points in the same direction as x,y,z but with length one.

    parent_z = parent[2]
    
    direction = Vector3(vertex_x - parent_x, vertex_y - parent_y, vertex_z - parent_z)
    length = sqrt(direction[0] * direction[0] + direction[1] * direction[1] + direction[2] * direction[2])

    direction = direction/length
